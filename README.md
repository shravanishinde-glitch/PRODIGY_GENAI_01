# PRODIGY_AI_01 — GPT-2 Fine-Tuning Project (Prodigy InfoTech Internship)

This project is part of my **Prodigy InfoTech Generative AI Internship (Task 1)**.

The goal of the task is to:
- Train a GPT-2 transformer model
- Fine-tune it on a custom dataset
- Generate coherent, contextually relevant text
- Understand how transformer-based language models work

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

I fine-tuned the **GPT-2** model from HuggingFace on my own dataset using Google Colab.  
The model learns the pattern, writing style, and structure of the dataset.

After training, I used the model to generate new text.

---

## 📌 Steps Performed

### 1. Installed Required Libraries
- transformers
- datasets
- torch
- accelerate

### 2. Loaded and Preprocessed Dataset
I used a custom text dataset (`dataset.txt`), tokenized it, padded it, and created labels for training.

### 3. Used GPT-2 Model + Tokenizer
- Loaded `gpt2`
- Added pad token
- Resized embeddings

### 4. Fine-Tuned the Model
Used HuggingFace `Trainer` API to train the model for 3 epochs.

### 5. Generated Text
After training, the model can generate new text based on prompts.
